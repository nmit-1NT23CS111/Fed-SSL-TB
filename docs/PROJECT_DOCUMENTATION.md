# PART 1: WHAT WE BUILT AND WHY

## 1.1 The Core Problem

Imagine you are a hospital in Chennai. You have thousands of chest X-rays. Some of these patients have **Tuberculosis (TB)**, and some do not. You want to train an AI to detect TB automatically.

**Problem 1 — Labels are Expensive**: A qualified radiologist has to look at each X-ray and label it "TB" or "Normal." This takes hours per image and costs a lot. You have 46,000 images. You don't have labels for most of them.

**Problem 2 — Privacy Laws**: A hospital in Bengaluru also has X-rays. If you could combine your data with theirs, your AI would be 2x smarter. But **HIPAA** (US) and **PDPA** (India) make it illegal to share raw patient data with another organization. Hospitals get sued if they share photos.

**Problem 3 — Small Labeled Sets Per Hospital**: Even if each hospital labels some of their own data, each one only has maybe 50-100 labeled samples. That's too few for traditional deep learning.

## 1.2 Our Three-Part Solution

We solved all three problems:

| Problem | Our Solution | Technology Used |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Too few labels | Learn from **unlabeled** images | **Masked Autoencoder (MAE)** |
| Can't share images | Share only model weights | **Federated Learning** |
| Too few labeled samples | Learn from 5 examples per class | **Prototypical Networks** |

## 1.3 The Three Stages of the System

```
STAGE 1 (Pre-training):
  5 Hospitals → Each runs MAE on their unlabeled NIH images → Sends weights to server → Server averages → Global Encoder

STAGE 2 (Fine-tuning):
  Global Encoder (frozen) → Feed labeled Shenzhen X-rays → Compute TB/Normal Prototypes → Train Projection Head

STAGE 3 (Evaluation):
  Encoder + Projection Head → Feed Montgomery X-rays (never seen before) → AUC, Sensitivity, Specificity
```

# PART 4: THE CONFIGURATION FILE

## File: `configs/default.yaml`

This file controls ALL hyperparameters. You change one number here, and it affects the whole system. This is a standard design pattern called "Config-Driven Training."

```yaml
model:
  backbone: resnet50       # Which encoder to use: 'resnet50' or 'vit_small'
  embed_dim: 512           # Size of the feature vector each image becomes
  mask_ratio: 0.75         # 75% of patches are hidden during MAE pre-training
  decoder_depth: 4         # How many layers the decoder has

data:
  nih_path: data/raw/NIH   # Path to NIH unlabeled images
  shenzhen_path: data/raw/Shenzhen   # Path to Shenzhen labeled images
  montgomery_path: data/raw/Montgomery  # Path to Montgomery test images
  image_size: 224          # Every image is resized to 224x224
  num_hospitals: 5         # Simulate 5 hospitals
  split_strategy: dirichlet  # How to assign NIH images to hospitals

ssl:
  lr: 0.0001               # Learning rate for SSL pre-training (AdamW)
  batch_size: 16           # How many images per GPU batch
  epochs_per_round: 1      # How many epochs each hospital trains per round

federated:
  rounds: 5                # Number of federated rounds (we ran 3)
  aggregation: fedavg      # 'fedavg' or 'fedprox'
  fedprox_mu: 0.01         # How strong the FedProx "leash" is

finetuning:
  few_shot_k: 5            # 5 labeled examples per class
  lr: 0.001                # Higher LR for fine-tuning
  epochs: 30               # Epochs for the prototypical head

logging:
  checkpoint_dir: experiments/checkpoints  # Where to save .pt files
  log_dir: experiments/logs                # Where to save training_log.json
```

### How the config is loaded — `src/utils/config.py`

```python
import yaml
from types import SimpleNamespace

def load_config(path="configs/default.yaml"):
    with open(path, "r") as f:
        raw = yaml.safe_load(f)   # Reads the YAML and converts to a Python dict
    return dict_to_namespace(raw)  # Converts dict → object so we can do config.model.backbone

def dict_to_namespace(d):
    # Recursively turns {'model': {'backbone': 'resnet50'}} into config.model.backbone
    if isinstance(d, dict):
        return SimpleNamespace(**{k: dict_to_namespace(v) for k, v in d.items()})
    return d
```

**What this means:** Instead of writing `config['model']['backbone']`, we can write `config.model.backbone`. Much cleaner.

# PART 5: THE DATA PIPELINE (src/datasets/)

## File: `src/datasets/loader.py`

### 5.1 Image Normalization (Why we use these numbers)

```python
IMAGENET_MEAN = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
IMAGENET_STD  = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
```

**Why these numbers?** These are the average pixel values (mean) and spread (standard deviation) computed across the 1.2 million images in the ImageNet dataset. Even though our images are X-rays, using ImageNet normalization works well because our ResNet50 encoder was pre-trained on ImageNet. Normalization means **pixel values that were [0, 255] become approximately [-2.0, 2.0]**. This makes gradient descent more stable during training.

### 5.2 Image Transforms — What happens to every image

```python
def get_base_transform(image_size: int = 224) -> T.Compose:
    return T.Compose([
        T.Resize((image_size + 32, image_size + 32)),  # First resize to 256x256
        T.RandomCrop(image_size),      # Then randomly crop to 224x224
        T.RandomHorizontalFlip(),      # 50% chance of  flipping left-right
        T.Grayscale(num_output_channels=3),  # X-rays are black & white → we fake 3 channels
        T.ToTensor(),                  # PIL Image → PyTorch Tensor (0→1 range)
        T.Normalize(mean=IMAGENET_MEAN, std=IMAGENET_STD),  # Normalize values
    ])
```

**Step by step:**
1. `Resize(256, 256)` → A 2048x2048 X-ray becomes a smaller 256x256 version.
2. `RandomCrop(224)` → Randomly cut out a 224x224 window. This is data augmentation — every epoch sees a slightly different view.
3. `RandomHorizontalFlip()` → Flips lungs left-right. An AI that can detect TB in a flipped lung is more robust.
4. `Grayscale(3)` → X-rays are single-channel (just grey values). We duplicate this channel 3 times to pretend it's RGB, so ResNet50 (which expects 3-channel input) works.
5. `ToTensor()` → Converts the PIL image from shape `(224, 224, 3)` to PyTorch tensor `(3, 224, 224)`. Also scales pixel values from `[0, 255]` to `[0.0, 1.0]`.
6. `Normalize()` → Applies `(pixel - mean) / std` per channel.

**Evaluation transforms are different (deterministic — no random ops):**
```python
def get_eval_transform(image_size: int = 224) -> T.Compose:
    return T.Compose([
        T.Resize((image_size, image_size)),   # Directly to 224x224, no crop randomness
        T.Grayscale(num_output_channels=3),
        T.ToTensor(),
        T.Normalize(mean=IMAGENET_MEAN, std=IMAGENET_STD),
    ])
```

### 5.3 Two-View Transform (For SSL)

```python
class TwoViewTransform:
    def __init__(self, base_transform):
        self.transform = base_transform

    def __call__(self, img):
        return self.transform(img), self.transform(img)
```

This applies the transform **twice** to the same image, producing two slightly different random crops/flips of the same X-ray. The MAE uses only `view1`, but the class is designed to support future contrastive SSL methods.

### 5.4 NIHDataset — The Unlabeled Dataset

```python
class NIHDataset(Dataset):
    def __init__(self, root_dir, transform=None, image_size=224, two_view=True):
        self.root_dir = Path(root_dir)
        self.two_view = two_view

        # This line finds ALL .png, .jpg, .jpeg files recursively in all subfolders
        self.image_paths = []
        for ext in ("*.png", "*.jpg", "*.jpeg"):
            self.image_paths.extend(sorted(self.root_dir.glob(f"**/{ext}")))

        # Use TwoViewTransform by default for SSL
        if transform is not None:
            self.transform = transform
        elif two_view:
            self.transform = TwoViewTransform(get_base_transform(image_size))
        else:
            self.transform = get_base_transform(image_size)

    def __len__(self):
        return len(self.image_paths)  # Number of total images found

    def __getitem__(self, idx):
        img = Image.open(self.image_paths[idx]).convert("RGB")
        return self.transform(img)  # Returns (view1, view2) tuple if two_view=True
```

**Key Points:**
- The `**` in `glob(f"**/{ext}")` means "search inside all subfolders recursively."
- `.convert("RGB")` ensures the image is in 3-channel format even if saved as grayscale.
- There are **no labels returned**. We only return images. This is intentional — MAE doesn't need labels.

### 5.5 ShenzhenDataset — Labeled, for Fine-tuning

```python
class ShenzhenDataset(Dataset):
    def __init__(self, root_dir, transform=None, image_size=224, split="all"):
        self.root_dir = Path(root_dir)
        self.transform = transform or get_base_transform(image_size)
        self.image_paths = []
        self.labels = []

        tb_dir = self.root_dir / "TB"
        normal_dir = self.root_dir / "Normal"

        if tb_dir.exists() and normal_dir.exists():
            # If subfolders exist, label is determined by which folder the image is in
            for ext in ("*.png", "*.jpg", "*.jpeg"):
                for p in sorted(tb_dir.glob(f"**/{ext}")):
                    self.image_paths.append(p)
                    self.labels.append(1)   # 1 = TB
                for p in sorted(normal_dir.glob(f"**/{ext}")):
                    self.image_paths.append(p)
                    self.labels.append(0)   # 0 = Normal
        else:
            # Fallback: infer label from filename
            # Files ending in _1 (e.g., CXR_001_1.png) = TB
            # Files ending in _0 (e.g., CXR_001_0.png) = Normal
            for ext in ("*.png", "*.jpg", "*.jpeg"):
                for p in sorted(self.root_dir.glob(f"**/{ext}")):
                    name = p.stem
                    if name.endswith("_1"):
                        label = 1
                    elif name.endswith("_0"):
                        label = 0
                    else:
                        continue  # Unknown files are ignored
                    self.image_paths.append(p)
                    self.labels.append(label)

    def __getitem__(self, idx):
        img = Image.open(self.image_paths[idx]).convert("RGB")
        label = self.labels[idx]
        return self.transform(img), label  # Returns (image_tensor, label) tuple
```

### 5.6 Hospital Data Splitting — `src/datasets/splitter.py`

Once we have all 46,718 NIH images, we split them across 5 hospitals using a **Dirichlet Distribution**.

```python
def split_nih_to_hospitals(dataset, num_hospitals=5, strategy="dirichlet", ...):
    labels = dataset.get_labels()    # List of 0/1 labels for each image
    all_indices = np.arange(len(dataset))
    
    if strategy == "dirichlet":
        alpha = 0.5   # Controls imbalance. Lower = more uneven split.
        # For each class, sample proportions across hospitals using Dirichlet
        class_indices = {c: np.where(labels == c)[0] for c in unique_classes}
        hospital_indices = [[] for _ in range(num_hospitals)]
        
        for class_idx_list in class_indices.values():
            # Sample proportions from Dirichlet distribution
            proportions = np.random.dirichlet([alpha] * num_hospitals)
            # Split class images across hospitals according to these proportions
            splits = (proportions * len(class_idx_list)).astype(int)
            ...
```

**Why Dirichlet α=0.5?** This produces a realistic "unfair" split. In real life, Hospital A (TB specialist) might have 80% TB patients, while Hospital B (general clinic) only has 10% TB. The Dirichlet distribution simulates this naturally.

The split **indices** (not the actual images) are saved to `data/processed/hospital_1/indices.npy`. This means on the next run, the split doesn't need to be recomputed.

# PART 6: THE MODELS (src/models/)

## File: `src/models/encoder.py`

### 6.1 What is an Encoder?

An **Encoder** is the part of the AI that "looks" at an image and converts it from a 3×224×224 pixel grid into a compact **512-dimensional vector** (a list of 512 numbers). This vector is called an **embedding** or **feature vector**.

Think of it like this: a human can look at an X-ray and describe what they see using 512 "features" — opacity here, texture there, etc. The encoder learns to do exactly this.

### 6.2 ResNet50 Encoder

```python
class ResNet50Encoder(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, embed_dim: int = 512):
        super().__init__()
        self.embed_dim = embed_dim

        # Load a pretrained ResNet50 (weights from ImageNet training)
        backbone = timm.create_model("resnet50", pretrained=True, num_classes=0)
        # num_classes=0 removes the final classification layer
        # backbone now just outputs a 2048-dim feature vector

        # We take all layers EXCEPT the final classification head
        self.feature_extractor = nn.Sequential(*list(backbone.children())[:-1])
        # ^ This gives us: Conv layers → BatchNorm → ReLU → AvgPool → (2048-dim output)

        # Project 2048 dims → embed_dim (512)
        self.projection = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Flatten(),               # Flatten (B, 2048, 1, 1) → (B, 2048)
            nn.Linear(2048, embed_dim), # 2048 → 512
            nn.LayerNorm(embed_dim),    # Normalize the 512 values
        )

    def forward(self, x: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor:
        # x shape: (Batch, 3, 224, 224)
        features = self.feature_extractor(x)  # → (B, 2048, 1, 1)
        return self.projection(features)      # → (B, 512)
```

**Why ResNet50?** ResNet50 is a 50-layer Convolutional Neural Network. It was trained on 1.2 million ImageNet images and learned to extract general visual features (edges, textures, patterns). By using this as our "starting point," we don't need to train from zero.

## File: `src/models/mae.py` (The Most Important Model)

### 6.3 How the MAE Works: Step by Step

**Input**: A batch of 16 chest X-rays, each of size `(3, 224, 224)`.

**Step 1 — Patchify**:
```python
def patchify(self, x: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor:
    B, C, H, W = x.shape   # e.g., B=16, C=3, H=224, W=224
    p = self.patch_size      # p=16 (each patch is 16x16 pixels)
    h = w = H // p           # h = w = 224/16 = 14

    # Reshape the image tensor:
    # (16, 3, 224, 224) → (16, 3, 14, 16, 14, 16)  [split H and W into chunks of 16]
    x = x.reshape(B, C, h, p, w, p)
    
    # Permute: we want patches first, then pixels
    # (16, 3, 14, 16, 14, 16) → (16, 14, 14, 16, 16, 3)
    x = x.permute(0, 2, 4, 3, 5, 1)
    
    # Flatten each patch into one long vector: 16*16*3 = 768 numbers per patch
    # (16, 14, 14, 16, 16, 3) → (16, 196, 768)
    x = x.reshape(B, h * w, p * p * C)  # 196 = 14*14 patches; 768 = 16*16*3 pixels
    
    return x  # Shape: (16, 196, 768)
```

**Output**: Each image is now `(196, 768)` — 196 patches, each described by 768 pixel values.

**Step 2 — Random Masking (The Core of MAE)**:
```python
def random_masking(self, tokens, mask_ratio=0.75):
    B, N, D = tokens.shape   # B=16, N=196, D=512

    # How many patches to KEEP (show to the encoder)
    num_keep = int(N * (1 - mask_ratio))  # int(196 * 0.25) = 49 patches kept

    # Generate random noise to shuffle with
    noise = torch.rand(B, N, device=tokens.device)  # (16, 196) random values

    # Sort the noise: gives us a random ordering
    ids_shuffle = torch.argsort(noise, dim=1)  # e.g., [83, 12, 177, 4, ...]

    # The "inverse" of this sort — used later to RESTORE the original order
    ids_restore = torch.argsort(ids_shuffle, dim=1)

    # Keep only the first num_keep (49) patches
    ids_keep = ids_shuffle[:, :num_keep]  # (16, 49)
    visible_tokens = torch.gather(
        tokens, dim=1,
        index=ids_keep.unsqueeze(-1).expand(-1, -1, D)
    )  # → (16, 49, 512)

    # Create binary mask: 1 = masked (hidden), 0 = visible
    mask = torch.ones(B, N, device=tokens.device)
    mask[:, :num_keep] = 0
    mask = torch.gather(mask, dim=1, index=ids_restore)
    # mask now has 1s in the positions of the 147 hidden patches

    return visible_tokens, mask, ids_restore
    # visible_tokens: (16, 49, 512)  ← only these go to the encoder
    # mask: (16, 196)               ← used to compute loss on correct patches
    # ids_restore: (16, 196)        ← used by decoder to put patches back in order
```

**Step 3 — Encode Only Visible Patches**:
```python
def _encode_visible(self, visible_tokens):
    if self._is_resnet:
        # For ResNet, we use a lightweight 2-layer MLP per patch
        z = self.patch_encoder(visible_tokens)  # (B, 49, 512)
        return z
    else:
        # For ViT, we run the transformer blocks on the 49 visible tokens
        x = visible_tokens
        for block in self.encoder.vit.blocks:
            x = block(x)
        x = self.encoder.vit.norm(x)               # (B, 49, D_vit)
        z = self.encoder.projection(x)             # (B, 49, 512)
        return z
```

**Step 4 — Decode and Reconstruct**:

The Decoder (in `src/models/decoder.py`) receives the 49 encoded patches and a set of learned "MASK tokens" for the 147 hidden positions. It then tries to reconstruct all 196 patches.

**Step 5 — Compute Loss on ONLY the Hidden Patches**:
```python
def _mae_loss(self, pred, target, mask):
    # pred:   (16, 196, 768) — the decoder's guess for all 196 patches
    # target: (16, 196, 768) — the actual pixels of all 196 patches
    # mask:   (16, 196)      — 1=hidden, 0=visible

    loss = F.mse_loss(pred, target, reduction="none")  # MSE per pixel → (16, 196, 768)
    loss = loss.mean(dim=-1)  # Average pixel error per patch → (16, 196)
    
    # CRITICAL: only compute loss on the patches that were HIDDEN (mask==1)
    loss = (loss * mask).sum() / (mask.sum() + 1e-8)
    # If we computed loss on visible patches too, the model could "cheat" by
    # just copying the input. We want it to be forced to PREDICT the missing parts.
    
    return loss  # A scalar value like 0.4315
```

**The full forward pass summary:**
```python
def forward(self, x):

### 6.5 PrototypicalHead — The TB Detector

After pre-training, the encoder knows how to "see" X-rays. Now we need a small extra component to classify them.

```python
class PrototypicalHead(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, embed_dim=512, num_classes=2, use_linear=True):
        super().__init__()
        self.embed_dim = embed_dim      # 512
        self.num_classes = num_classes  # 2: (Normal, TB)

        # Optional linear head (for cross-entropy fallback)
        if use_linear:
            self.linear_head = nn.Linear(512, 2)

        # OUR INNOVATION: A 2-layer MLP that learns a "TB-Metric Space"
        # This "Projection" warps the 512-dim space so TB and Normal
        # X-rays are as far apart as possible.
        self.projection = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Linear(512, 512),   # Linear transformation
            nn.ReLU(),             # Non-linearity (makes it non-trivial)
            nn.Linear(512, 512),   # Second linear transformation
        )

        # Buffer to store prototypes (not a learnable parameter)
        # Shape: (2, 512) — one 512-dim prototype per class
        self.register_buffer("prototypes", torch.zeros(2, 512))
        self._prototypes_computed = False
```

**Computing Prototypes (Finding the "Center"):**
```python
def compute_prototypes(self, support_embeddings, support_labels):
    # support_embeddings: (10, 512) — 5 TB + 5 Normal embeddings
    # support_labels:     (10,)    — [1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0]

    prototypes = torch.zeros(2, 512, device=support_embeddings.device)
    
    for c in range(2):  # c=0 for Normal, c=1 for TB
        mask = (support_labels == c)  # Boolean mask: which samples are class c
        if mask.sum() > 0:
            # Take the MEAN of all embeddings of this class
            # For Normal (c=0): average of 5 Normal X-ray embeddings
            # For TB (c=1): average of 5 TB X-ray embeddings
            prototypes[c] = support_embeddings[mask].mean(dim=0)

    self.prototypes = prototypes  # Store for use in forward()
    return prototypes
```

**Computing the Learnable Prototypes (with projection for gradients):**
```python
def get_learnable_prototypes(self, support_embeddings, support_labels):
    # Same as above, but we run embeddings through the projection layer FIRST
    # This allows gradients to flow back to the projection layer during training
    support_embeddings = self.projection(support_embeddings)
    
    prototypes = torch.zeros(2, 512, device=support_embeddings.device)
    for c in range(2):
        mask = (support_labels == c)
        if mask.sum() > 0:
            prototypes[c] = support_embeddings[mask].mean(dim=0)
    return prototypes
```

**Classification using Distance:**
```python
def forward(self, query_embeddings, prototypes=None):
    if prototypes is None:
        prototypes = self.prototypes

    # Project query embeddings into the metric space
    query_embeddings = self.projection(query_embeddings)  # (N, 512)

    return self._prototypical_logits(query_embeddings, prototypes)

def _prototypical_logits(self, queries, protos):
    # queries: (N, 512), protos: (2, 512)
    # We compute the Euclidean distance from every query to every prototype

    # Broadcasting: expand to (N, 2, 512) and compute squared difference
    diffs = queries.unsqueeze(1) - protos.unsqueeze(0)  # (N, 2, 512)
    sq_dists = (diffs ** 2).sum(dim=-1)                 # (N, 2) — one dist per class

    logits = -sq_dists        # Flip sign: smaller distance = higher score
    probs = F.softmax(logits, dim=-1)  # Convert to probabilities summing to 1.0
    return probs  # (N, 2) — prob[i][0]=P(Normal), prob[i][1]=P(TB)
```

# PART 8: THE SERVER (src/server/)

## File: `src/server/aggregator.py` — The Math of Aggregation

### FedAvg — The Weighted Average

```python
def fedavg(encoder_weights_list, sample_counts):
    # encoder_weights_list: [hospital1_weights, hospital2_weights, ..., hospital5_weights]
    # sample_counts: [9343, 9343, 9344, 9344, 9344]  (approximately equal for NIH)

    total_samples = sum(sample_counts)  # e.g., 46718

    # Each hospital gets a weight proportional to how much data it contributed
    weights = [n / total_samples for n in sample_counts]
    # weights ≈ [0.2, 0.2, 0.2, 0.2, 0.2] when data is evenly split

    # Start with the first hospital's weights, scaled by its proportion
    agg_weights = copy.deepcopy(encoder_weights_list[0])
    for key in agg_weights:
        agg_weights[key] = agg_weights[key].float() * weights[0]

    # Add each remaining hospital's contribution
    for i in range(1, len(encoder_weights_list)):
        for key in agg_weights:
            if encoder_weights_list[i][key].dtype.is_floating_point:
                agg_weights[key] += encoder_weights_list[i][key].float() * weights[i]

    # agg_weights is now the weighted average of all 5 hospitals' encoders
    return agg_weights
```

**The math written out:**
```
Global_Weight[layer] = (n1/N) * W1[layer] + (n2/N) * W2[layer] + ... + (n5/N) * W5[layer]

Where:
  n1, n2, ..., n5 = number of samples at each hospital
  N = total samples
  W1, W2, ..., W5 = each hospital's encoder weight matrix for that layer
```

### FedProx — Training-side Regularization

The server-side aggregation for FedProx is **identical to FedAvg**. The difference happens at the **client** side during training. On the client, we add an extra term to the loss:

```
total_loss = MAE_reconstruction_loss + (μ/2) × ||w_local - w_global||²
```

```python
# In ssl_train.py (hospital side):
proximal_term = (mu / 2.0) * torch.sum(
    (local_params_flat - global_params_flat) ** 2
)
loss = loss + proximal_term
```

This penalizes the hospital's model for straying too far from the global model. The smaller `μ` (mu), the weaker the leash.

from sklearn.metrics import roc_auc_score, roc_curve, confusion_matrix, accuracy_score

def evaluate(y_true, y_pred_proba):
    # y_true: [0, 1, 0, 0, 1, ...] — actual labels from Montgomery dataset
    # y_pred_proba: [0.12, 0.87, 0.23, 0.45, 0.91, ...] — our model's P(TB)

    # AUC: If you randomly pick 1 TB patient and 1 Normal patient,
    # AUC = probability the model gives higher TB-score to the TB patient
    auc = roc_auc_score(y_true, y_pred_proba)  # e.g., 0.8942

    # Convert probabilities to binary predictions (threshold = 0.5)
    y_pred = (y_pred_proba >= 0.5).astype(int)

    # Confusion matrix:
    # [[TN, FP],   TN = True Normal, FP = False Positive (said TB but was Normal)
    #  [FN, TP]]   FN = False Negative (said Normal but had TB!), TP = True Positive
    tn, fp, fn, tp = confusion_matrix(y_true, y_pred).ravel()

    sensitivity = tp / (tp + fn)  # = Recall = how many TB cases we caught
    specificity = tn / (tn + fp)  # how many Normal cases we correctly cleared
    accuracy    = (tp + tn) / (tp + tn + fp + fn)
    f1          = 2 * tp / (2 * tp + fp + fn)

    return {
        "auc": auc,
        "accuracy": accuracy,
        "sensitivity": sensitivity,
        "specificity": specificity,
        "f1": f1,
    }
```

### Our Results After Round 3

| Metric | Score | What it means |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| AUC | 0.8942 | 89% chance our model ranks TB above Normal correctly |
| Accuracy | 0.8421 | 84% of all patients correctly classified |
| Sensitivity | 0.8800 | Out of 100 TB patients → 88 correctly detected as TB |
| Specificity | 0.8125 | Out of 100 Normal patients → 81 correctly cleared as Normal |

# PART 11: THE TRAINING LOGS (experiments/logs/training_log.json)

After every round, the logger saves data like this to `training_log.json`:

```json
[
  {
    "round": 0,
    "mean_ssl_loss": 0.7823,
    "hospital_losses": [0.7901, 0.7755, 0.8012, 0.7644, 0.7803],
    "sample_counts": [9343, 9343, 9344, 9344, 9344]
  },
  {
    "round": 1,
    "mean_ssl_loss": 0.5541,
    "hospital_losses": [0.5620, 0.5490, 0.5611, 0.5420, 0.5563],
    "sample_counts": [9343, 9343, 9344, 9344, 9344]
  },
  {
    "round": 2,
    "mean_ssl_loss": 0.4315,
    "hospital_losses": [0.4401, 0.4289, 0.4380, 0.4212, 0.4283],
    "sample_counts": [9343, 9343, 9344, 9344, 9344],
    "eval_metrics": {
      "auc": 0.8942,
      "accuracy": 0.8421,
      "sensitivity": 0.88,
      "specificity": 0.8125,
      "f1": 0.8311
    }
  }
]
```

**Reading this:** The `mean_ssl_loss` going from 0.78 → 0.55 → 0.43 over 3 rounds means the model is getting better at reconstructing X-rays. A lower loss = better features = better downstream TB classification.
