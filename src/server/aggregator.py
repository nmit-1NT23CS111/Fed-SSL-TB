------------------------
Federated aggregation strategies: FedAvg and FedProx.

Design Notes:
  - FedAvg  : Weighted average of local encoder state_dicts
  - FedProx : Same aggregation as FedAvg on the SERVER side.
              The proximal regularization term (μ/2 * ||w - w_global||²)
              is added in the CLIENT's loss inside ssl_train.py.
